This project is based on mobile analysis of mobile which is sales in the year 2023 about the brands, models, operating systems, Network Bands, etc all related to the phone


Software used - MySQL, Microsoft Power BI


1. Downloaded the Excel data of mobile analysis in the online data platform, The Excel data is converted into a CSV file.

2. Using MySQL created a Schema for mobile analysis and uploaded the Excel CSV file in the MySQL table column. We separate the data and visuals as the row and columns per the requirements

3. After using my SQL imported the data from MySQL to Microsoft Power BI, In Microsoft Power BI used the imported data to make the visualization of mobile analysis 2023 using the given chart in the Power Bi.


I attach all the resources in this Git Hub, then the power bi visualization I submitted in PDF format because now I am not having office access to give an interactive dashboard like Tableau.
